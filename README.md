# Angular Task Management Project

## About the Project
This project was developed as a learning experience with Angular 19. It is a simple task management application where tasks are assigned to users. Users can create new tasks and mark them as completed.

## Features
- Display tasks by user.
- Create new tasks for a user.
- Mark tasks as completed.

## Future Plans
- Create project groups and connect users to projects.
- Add the option to create new users.
- Define user roles (Collaborator, Project Manager).
- Set task priority levels.
- Store tasks in a database instead of local storage.
- Implement user authentication (Login/Register).

Currently, tasks are stored in local storage, but a future update will integrate a database for better persistence and scalability. Additionally, a login/register system will be implemented to manage user access and permissions.

## Technologies Used
- **Angular 19**
